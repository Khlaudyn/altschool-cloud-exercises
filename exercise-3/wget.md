If you want to download a file from within the terminal, the wget command is one of the handiest command-line utilities available.

When you specify the link for download, it has to directly be a link to the file. If the file cannot be accessed by the wget command, it will simply download the webpage in HTML format instead of the actual file that you wanted.
